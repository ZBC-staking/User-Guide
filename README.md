Staking ZBC is not only a high-return activity – it’s also easy.

This guide will walk you through the process step-by-step so that anyone can go from buying their first ZBC to earning rewards.

The overall process is:

1. Buy ZBC from a CEX
2. Bridge your ZBC from BNB or Solana to Nautilus
3. Stake your ZBC using the ZBC Staking Platform on Nautilus Chain
Let’s dive in!

Buying ZBC from a CEX

To buy ZBC, first go to a CEX where you can find ZBC like [Huobi](www.huobi.com), [OKX](www.okx.com), and
[Gate.io](www.gate.io). We’ll be adding more CEXs and DEXs in the coming months.

NOTE: Currently, you can be ZBC on the BNB network or on the Solana
network. Make sure you know which network you are using, as you will need
that information when bridging to the Nautilus Chain.

Once you have ZBC, you’ll need to transfer your tokens to your own wallet.
You’ll need to make sure you transfer your ZBC to a wallet that works for the
[Nautilus Chain bridge](www.nautilusbridge.com). If you are transferring ZBC on Solana, you can use
Phantom, Solflare, Ledger, and Trust. If you are using ZBC on the BNB
network, you can use MetaMask, Coinbase, Trust Wallet, and Argent, among
many others.

Bridging Your ZBC to Nautilus
Once you have ZBC in your own wallet, you can use the [Nautilus Chain bridge](www.nautilusbridge.com). To
start, choose the origin network of your ZBC and connect your wallet.

From there, you can simply input how many ZBC tokens you want to bridge to the Nautilus Chain.

After choosing how many tokens you wish to transfer, select which address you want to receive the tokens. If you select “Self,” it should auto-populate your own EVM wallet address, but it is also good to double-check everything. 

Once completed, you will have ZBC in your EVM wallet, like MetaMask, on the Nautilus network. Congrats! You are ready to stake ZBC on Nautilus.

You can find more details [here](docs.nautchain.xyz/nautilus-bridge) if you get stuck, or reach out on our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/pEgPqTS7JX).

NOTES on Bridging ZBC on Solana

When bridging from Solana to Nautilus, keep a couple of things in mind:

First, even if you are bridging from Solana, it’s still best to connect with your EVM wallet (like MetaMask) before initiating the bridging transaction. This will help auto-populate the correct address when you are bridging to one of your own wallets.


Second, there are two ZBC tokens on Solana, ZBC and wZBC, but you can only bridge wZBC to Nautilus. You can easily get wZBC by visiting  [here](https://swap.zebec.io/) and connecting a Solana wallet.



Stake on ZBC on Nautilus Chain

To start staking, visit the staking page [here](www.zbcstaking.com).

First, you’ll need to connect your wallet. 

To connect your wallet on a web browser, click the "Connect" button on the navigation bar. On a mobile browser, click the hamburger menu on the right side of the navigation bar. After the menu appears, click the "Connect" button at the bottom.
Next, you’ll need to decide on a staking package. Put in the amount of ZBC you want to stake and what staking package you prefer. The longer you stake, the greater your return:


Staking Period
Annualized Return Rate
18 Days
8%
88 Days
18%
188 Days
28%
888 Days
38%




To stake 25%, 50%, 75% or 100% of the total amount of ZBC in your wallet, you can use the preset buttons or simply put in the exact amount you want to stake.

After confirming everything is correct, click the "Stake" button.  


Your wallet will open, and you need to confirm the transaction. Once you have, you will have staked your first ZBC! 


NOTE: Your wallet needs to have at least 11 ZBC for staking. The last 10 ZBC in your wallet will be reserved to ensure smooth withdrawals.



How to Withdraw ZBC: 
You can withdraw your ZBC at any time, but if you withdraw it before completing your staking package set time period, you will incur a penalty of 88% of the yield you would have earned from the start of the period.

Each of your active staking amounts and packages will appear in the "Active Stake" list on the stake page. If a plan has reached maturity, the withdrawal button will be green.

If the withdrawal button is red, it means the plan has not yet reached maturity, and withdrawing early will incur a fee of 88% of the amount your stake would have earned at the time of the early withdrawal.  


If the end time turns red, it means you have exceeded the withdrawal time, and you should withdraw your stake to put it to use.

Each of your withdrawal orders will appear in the "Historical Orders" list.



How to Claim Your Earnings and Rewards
You can claim the interest your principal has earned at any time. Doing so will not withdraw the principle, and your order will continue to generate earnings.

Click the "Claim" link on the navigation bar to access the "Claim" page. Click the  "Claim" button to claim the earnings generated from all active stakes. You can click the refresh icon next to the withdrawable amount at any time to refresh the  earnings. 

NOTE: Make sure to come to this page and Refresh your profile periodically. We track many actions off-chain, and refreshing your profile helps us track your actions for rewards more accurately. 


Referral Codes

You can share a personal referral code to boost your earnings. You’ll earn a percentage of the yield your referees earn based on how much they have staked with your code.

To get a referral code, you’ll first need to stake any amount of ZBC. Then, go to the “Refer” page in the navigation bar and click on “Generate.”


Confirm the ZBC cost for purchasing the invitation code, and then click the OK button.  Open your wallet and confirm the transaction. Once you have purchased an  invitation code, you can copy the code or copy the invitation link.


In the "Invitation History" table, you can view the information of users who joined  using your invitation code.



Congratulations on Staking Your First ZBC!

With that, you have now gone from not owning any ZBC to staking it on Nautilus Chain! You are not only earning lucrative token rewards, but you’ve also joined a global community of people working to bring L3 chains to Web3. Together we are pushing the boundaries of crypto technology to speed mass adoption.

But those efforts only work because of your support as a community member. Thank you for being part of the modular L3 chain movement! 

Keep your eyes on our social channels for upcoming campaigns and updates. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out on our [Telegram](www.t.me/nautchain) or [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/pEgPqTS7JX). 


About Nautilus

Nautilus Chain is the first production-ready modular chain in Web3. Through its modular architecture, Nautilus combines the speed of Solana with the decentralization and security of Ethereum to become the fastest EVM chain available, capable of parallel transaction processing.

Developers can use Nautilus to build next-generation payment dApps capable of real-time settlement. Nautilus provides Solidity developers with the efficiency and customization to build dApps that wouldn’t be possible on other EVM foundations.

With Nautilus, Web3 technology will have the reliability and scalability needed to replace traditional payment rails worldwide.
